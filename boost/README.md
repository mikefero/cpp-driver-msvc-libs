# Boost

Each archive contains the associated Boost version with all the header files
and only the libraries required for building the testing executable(s). Only
the multi-threaded static release builds of the following libraries are
included in order to keep the archives small:

  - atomic
  - chrono
  - date_time
  - filesystem
  - log
  - log_setup
  - regex
  - system
  - thread
  - unit_test_framework
